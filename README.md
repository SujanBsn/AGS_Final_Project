# AGS_Final_Project
This is the evaluation task of the internship.
I've decided to implement the following strategy:

-For playing notes:
    -Use the new input system.
    -Make 6 strings.
    -For each string have the following:
        -Start Point
        -End Point
        -Bridge point
        -Mover
        -Mute String
        -A slider
    -The slider can be clicked for 
        -left right movement(left click)
        -pull off(middle click)
        -hammer ons(right click)
        
-For Comparing pieces of music:
    -Create audio spectrum of two audio clips
    -Display the two spectrum graphs for visualization
    -Calculate the visual differnce between the graphs(pixel-wise differences)
    -Display the difference as a percentage
    
-For Unit Tests:
    -Created for testing the comparison script
    -Checks if the audio clips is null
    -Checks if the difference is calculated properly
    -Implement these tests in both edit mode and play mode
